  <p id="doc_install">Installation</p>
  Generally application should be installed on your Virtual Private Server (VPS). Where your trading/investment terminals run.
  FinCore application is completely crossplatform.
  You can biuld it for Windows, MacOS, Linux/Docker and run it there. <br>
  There are 3 options to run FinCore application:<br>
  <p>As a Windows Service</p>
  <p>As an usual console application</p>
  <p>As a Docker image in a Docker container</p>

  When application started it becomes accessible by this link: http://localhost:2020 <br>
  Websockets port uses port 2021.
  Make sure ports 2020 and 2021 are opened to make FinCore accesible outside of VPS.
  If you run application in docker to connect it to Windows where Metatrader terminals live - you should activate ports forwarding in Windows to docker address:<br>
  Run this command in windows command line:<br>
  <code>netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2020 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=2020 connectaddress='docker container address'</code>
  <br>
  For TCP Messages call this command:<br>
  <code>netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2022 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=2022 connectaddress='docker container address'</code>
  <br>
  After that all experts in Metatrader will use be able to synchronize with FinCore app running in Docker or on another machine/OS.
